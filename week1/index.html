            <h2>This week's learning outcome:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This week I was able to create the Github Pages index.html, make the main.js to manage the navigation
            Table of Contents, and create this page with the associated navigation links.</li>
                <li>I also spent extra attention to structuring and identifying my html for easier css styling later, some of which is managed in my main.js</li>
                <li>Readings were completed</li>
                <li>All tasks, videos, and environments are set up for the coming weeks.</li>
            </ul>
